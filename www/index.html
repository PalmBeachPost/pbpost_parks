				<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>y childhood was spent viewing the spectacular mesas of the magnificent Grand Canyon, running to my parents in the early evening terrified by the piercing howls from a pack of Yellowstone coyotes and digging at dawn for Pacific razor clams on the beaches of the Olympic Peninsula.</p>
				<p>I witnessed a meteor shower that filled the Arizona night sky with hundreds of streaking lights so captivating it seemed as if I was in another galaxy. I bounced my basketball against the wall of a 1700s-era house occupied by a blacksmith during the Revolutionary War. I hiked canyons, toured rain forests and explored glaciers.</p>
				<p>There were snowmobile rides, bear sightings, waterfalls, vividly colored hot springs, geysers, Havasupi and Navajo Indians and school field trips to breathtaking mountain ranges.</p>
				<p>But these encounters weren&rsquo;t vacations. They were all in my back yard (or sometimes front yard!) I grew up in the national parks, living in eight of them before high school. My childhood was an amazing experience that was part history lesson and part Western adventure &mdash; a personal journey filled with this country&rsquo;s natural and historic treasures.</p>
				<p>So when I hear the excitement in the voices of those who are about to hit the road to experience their adventure of a lifetime, it always sparks a warm memory.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap" style="color:#00203F;">P</span>ack. Unpack. Repack. There were always a lot of boxes in my life.</p>
				<p>And when people ask me where I grew up, the conversation generally goes like this:</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Grow up? Kind of all over the country to be honest.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, were you a military brat?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No, I was a park service brat.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>My father grew up in Gettysburg National Military Park, where my grandfather was superintendent. That historic land and his father&rsquo;s influence were the reasons my dad decided to also have a career in the National Park Service, but he admits he never imagined the places it would take his family.</p>

				<p>I always loved his uniform &mdash; the gray shirt, green pants, distinguished hat and the patch &mdash; a design that featured an arrowhead, Sequoia tree, bison and distant mountains. When I was 6, my mother sewed one of the patches onto my jacket, giving me sort of an official title of associate kid park ranger.</p>
				<p>My father&rsquo;s career took off quickly and at age 29, he became one of the youngest superintendents when he was offered the top position at Mound City Group National Monument &mdash; site of prehistoric Indian burial mounds &mdash; in Chillicothe, Ohio, where I was born.</p>
				<p>But I don&rsquo;t remember my birthplace &mdash; we were on the move before any childhood memory could stick. About every two years, we packed up to the next park.<del> WHY EVERY TWO YEARS?</del> My dad&rsquo;s career took my mom, brother, sister and I to vast and beautiful western parks like Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Olympic along with the more colonial eastern sites like Independence, Saratoga and Morristown.</p>
				<p>Every stop was so unique and fascinating, but it was also an adjustment to new friends, schools, cultures and communities. (&ldquo;Do Indian kids even speak English?&rdquo; I wondered. &ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; my parents told me).</p>
				<p>I hated always being the &ldquo;new kid&rdquo; and quickly learned that the burden to introduce myself and make friends at recess and lunch was going to be on me. <del>did that lesson carry over into a career at newspapers?</del></p>
				<p>My father didn&rsquo;t necessarily seek such a transient life, but when he was presented with such amazing opportunities, he never turned them down.</p>
				<p>Perhaps anticipating that my siblings and I might have felt like we were being dragged from pillar to post, my parents would always bring out the colorful brochures and books of the new park where we were moving to, talking up our next adventure. So it was never advertised that we had to leave our home and friends behind, but rather, look what exciting escapade is around the corner.</p>

				<p class="caption pullout right">This is the caption for the image above</p>
				<p><span class="dropcap" style="color:#C8a436">T</span>hose colorful brochures of the parks were fun to look at, but trust me, they don&rsquo;t even come close to the real thing.</p>
				<p>Yellowstone is a real-life Jurassic Park. Known for geysers, hot springs, wilderness, grizzly bears, wolves, moose, bison and elk, I experienced a remote side of the park visitors can only imagine.</p>
				<p>The howling coyotes we heard at night were truly frightening. It was only when my mom took my older sister Theresa, younger brother Kenny and me to the window and from the darkness of our bedroom we could see the packs on the prowl. We sat there watching and a whole new world unfolded before us. A stray coyote would join with another coyote and soon they would join in with a few more. Before long we could see the pack form. We continue to sit and watch. It really helped take the fear out of the mysterious and haunting sounds.</p>
				<p>Most visitors had common sense that the park was not a petting zoo, but there were always incidents, especially with bears.</p>
				<p>Once, when we were driving through the park we came across a black bear and her two cubs crossing the road. One of the cubs was lollygagging behind and the mother bear, as if sensing her cub was holding up traffic, went back across the road and with a huge swooping motion from her massive paw, swatted the cub, who became &ldquo;one big ball of fur rolling across the road,&rdquo; as my mom describes. <del>should you name mom and dad?</del></p>
				<p>Bears getting into garbage cans at campgrounds had to be tranquilized and tagged. Carried in giant hanging slings, helicopters would frequently transport them to a more remote part of the park. My siblings and I would always rush outside whenever we heard the sounds of a park helicopter to see the tranquilized bears dangling among the clouds. (A few years later when we lived in New Jersey, Kenny, who was 3, saw a traffic helicopter overhead and asked the perfectly logical question &ldquo;but mom, where&rsquo;s the bear?&rdquo;)</p>
				<p>Old Faithful <del>&mdash; a massive cone geyser that erupts almost every 90 minutes shooting 3,700 to 8,400 gallons of boiling water to the height of 180 feet for up to five minutes &mdash; </del>was the tourist hot spot, but there were many other clusters of geysers, hot springs, steam vents and mudpots <del>what&rsquo;s a mudpot?</del> that were fascinating.</p>
				<p>My personal favorites were the Fountain Paint Pots, these bubbling mudpots caused when rising steam forces its way upward from the ground, and Little Whirligig, named after its water swirls in its crater during eruptions. It also contained this orange-yellow iron oxide that made it really colorful.</p>
				<p>Morning Glory Pool, a hot spring in the Upper Geyser Basin, used to creep me out. It resembled an aqua blue steamy bottomless pit, something you would see out of a science fiction movie. I had nightmares about falling in it, never to be seen again.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap" style="color:#C8a436">I</span> was only 5 and 6 when I lived at Yellowstone so aside from catching a rainbow trout at Yellowstone Lake, I was limited to my share of outdoor adventure.</p>
				<p>But there was plenty at our second west spot &mdash; Grand Canyon, considered one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. It&rsquo;s difficult to truly comprehend the magnitude of the canyon and its distinct geological colors and rock formations without standing at its rim.</p>
				<p>The village of Grand Canyon was made up of park people, concession employees and Indians. That&rsquo;s it. The schoolhouse was what my mom described as a &ldquo;massive spectrum of education.&rdquo; Changing schools was always a challenge. Sometimes we were ahead and sometimes we were behind academically.</p>
				<p>I learned a lot in school from the adventurous field trips. Our fourth-grade class did a five-day hike up Humphreys Peak, the highest mountain in Arizona. I learned how to make a fire, cook food and most important to always check my shoes for scorpions before putting them on in the morning.</p>
				<p>I also learned the art of packing lightly because everything you bring you carry on your back!</p>
				<p><del>My sister&rsquo;s sixth-grade class got to go white-water rafting down the Salt River in Cibecue Canyon, an overnight field trip that nearly turned disastrous when it had rained a lot and the canyon river waters ran high, forcing them to climb a steep cliff at night to get to higher ground.</del></p>
				<p>From the south rim of the Grand Canyon to the bottom was a strenuous 7-mile hike that, at age 9, I wasn&rsquo;t old enough to tackle. My dad, however, did take me once on the Bright Angel Trail to Indian Gardens, halfway down. It was probably the least dangerous of the major inner-canyon trails, but I do remember there being a few tall climbs and some exposed areas where the path narrows next to a steep-sided cliff and no guardrail. Straight down. <del>makes me wonder how your parents dealt with the dangers for their children; did you get constant lectures? did they let you run around free? how did they teach you to survive?</del></p>
				<p>Like Yellowstone, Grand Canyon was filled with wildlife right around the house and I saw all of them up close &mdash; deer, coyotes, snakes, desert scorpions and bobcats. Mountain lions were in the vicinity too although I never witnessed one. <del>how did seeing those animals make you feel? do you visit zoos often? do you have a pet dog or cat? or do you now shun animals because you had enough as a child?</del></p>
				<p>The best part of Northern Arizona was the fresh air and open skies. At 7,200 feet above sea level, there was no smog or industrial pollution. Sometimes, my friend and I would sleep outside under the breathtaking night sky, which resembled our own private planetarium &mdash; a dazzling tapestry of sparkling jewels packed with shooting stars, constellations and bright planets. No special equipment needed.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap" style="color:#C8a436">O</span>lympic, just west of Seattle on the Washington state peninsula, was three parts &mdash; seashore, mountain range with a few glaciers and rain forests. This land of enchantment, especially the Quinault, Queets and Hoh rain forests, was straight out of a J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy novel.</p>
				<p>On the Pacific seashore amid the sea stacks, we would dig for razor clams (rightfully named as they had razor sharp shells) during the early dawn hours at minus tide &mdash; an unusually low tide when the clams would surface. Basically, you&rsquo;d look for a keyhole, or quarter-sized depression in the sand and then dig as fast as you can with a small shovel to get them. I soon found out how quickly they could cut deep through the soft fluid sand and avoid my grasp. With help, I&rsquo;d catch a few, but never the maximum 15 you could claim for the day. <del>good/vivid</del></p>
				<p>The beaches of the Olympic Peninsula are usually grey and thick with fog. If you were hiking on the beach, sometimes the fog would roll in so quickly couldn&rsquo;t see your hand in front of you. And you had to know your tide schedule. If you were caught observing the whales too long, those tides would roll in fast and you could get trapped on the beach with nothing between you and the ocean but the immense limestone cliffs.</p>
				<p>From our house on top of a hill, the view from my bedroom window was spectacular. Overlooking the Straights of Juan de Fuca, I used to watch the ferry boats come and go from Port Angeles to Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and at night I&rsquo;d see Victoria&rsquo;s bright lights glowing in the distance.</p>
				<p>Many of the houses I grew up in were very old and isolated. In Chillicothe, the superintendent&rsquo;s house was built in the 1930s. Down a dirt road less than 100 yards away was a federal prison and a quarter-mile in the opposite direction was a Veterans Administration hospital for mentally disturbed patients.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I was very cautious,&rdquo; my mother told me. &ldquo;I would get calls from time to time that a VA patient had escaped and was instructed to lock the doors. It was unnerving.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>One day, an inmate escaped from the prison and amid the shots being fired from the top of the prison tower, my mom rushed my sister and me into the basement while my dad ran to lock the doors of the house. The inmate was caught behind the park at the Scioto River, a deep, rushing river that likely trapped him.</p>
				<p>My favorite house growing up was at Morristown National Historical Park, which commemorates the sites of General Washington and the Continental army&rsquo;s winter encampment of December 1779 to June 1780.</p>
				<p>Our house was the original home of Joshua Guerin, a prosperous farmer and blacksmith who resided with his wife and eight children. It was a huge house with big Dutch doors, seven fireplaces, a gigantic garden, wide floorboards, a neat spiral staircase from my bedroom to the den and tall living room ceilings. <del>why was it your favorite?</del></p>
				<p>During the war, Guerin allowed the army to graze horses on the land and he sold hay and firewood to the army. Soldiers were sometimes quartered there and after the war, Guerin asked to be compensated for thefts by soldiers &mdash; potatoes, a silver spoon and even his wife&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
				<p>In the mid-1800s, the house was vacant and fell into disrepair, and those passing by found it to be an eerie sight. The Park Service acquired it in the 1930s and restored it and perhaps because it looked so abandoned, there were rumors that it was haunted.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be at cocktail parties and people would ask us if we&rsquo;d seen any ghosts,&rdquo; my mom laughed. &ldquo;They always had a look of disappointment when I said &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I never heard or saw any paranormal activity either and really was too consumed with the 1,300-acre backyard to care about ghosts. It was an endless playground where I could run and play football and baseball.</p>
				<p>When we moved in, the local newspaper wrote a profile on our family and the house and my mother gave perhaps the best description:</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sometimes when it&rsquo;s snowing and you&rsquo;re sitting in front of the fire, you almost expect to hear the troops marching by outside on the road.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap" style="color:#C8a436">I</span> am not sure, though, that Washington&rsquo;s winter of 1779-80 could match any of the winters we spent in<del>WHAT YEARS? IN</del> Saratoga, N.Y., where, thanks to home movies, I remember a lot, mostly from the as white-as-can-be snow and frigid air.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Three bad months of skiing weather,&rdquo; my grandfather told my parents.</p>
				<p>Every day, my sister and I would get into our snowsuits and play outside. My dad would build a huge snow igloo and tunnels that were the neatest things for a toddler. They snow palace lasted the whole winter and it was only in the spring that it would start to melt. The park also had its own snowmobile and I remember going on rides through the scenic and wintry trails.</p>
				<p>In the summer, my boyhood ambitions got the best of me and I would play on the cannons on the walkway of the visitor center, much to the annoyance of the park&rsquo;s chief historian.</p>
				<p>My best memory, though, were the magical icicles that hung on the eaves of our snow-covered house. Some the size of me would fall off and I would grab them and slurp them all day exploring the area in my snowsuit.</p>
				<p>It was amazing how warm and friendly the communities were in the parks. Some were very much like a &ldquo;Little House on the Prairie&rdquo; town where after 15 minutes of the moving van arriving, people came by to say hello (with brownies!) and offer a helping hand.</p>
				<p>After two years at Olympic, the National Park Service decided to transfer my father (this time not his choice) to deputy director of the Mid-Atlantic region. It was a management position and that meant no more park ranger uniform and hat, no more park housing and a bigger public school system in suburban Philadelphia.</p>
				<p>I was in high school now and decided my own path probably wouldn&rsquo;t be in the Park Service. Still, one summer I ran a gift shop at City Hall and another summer was a tour guide of a Quaker House at Independence National Park.</p>
				<p>I became very knowledgeable on the history of Liberty Bell, the Declaration of Independence, Ben Franklin and the Quakers &mdash; in those three months I learned more than I ever did from any American history textbook.</p>

				<p>Like the original vision of our Founding Fathers, moving around so much was in a way a symbol of independence and open-mindedness.<del> this seems a tad tortured; was the founding fathers&rsquo; original vision that people should move around a lot? </del> It showed me how to discover my personal road and to not be afraid of letting go because another adventure in life always awaits. <del>good</del></p>
				<p>Ironically, my first full-time job after college was in a town that featured another park &mdash; Gettysburg, where my grandfather had been superintendent of the battlefield site and where my father grew up.<del> be careful of throwing around irony; why is that ironic? it seems sensible; what is ironic is that you wanted nothing to do with national parks</del> But I was on my own path then as a journalist and was sports editor of the daily newspaper in town.</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;s funny looking back how much nature and adventure was in my life as a kid.</p>
				<p>I enjoyed those experiences, but if you asked me today how to start a fire, I&rsquo;d say give me a lighter. If you asked me how to build a tent, I&rsquo;d say I would need the directions. And if you wanted to go camping, I&rsquo;d probably suggest a Marriott or Hyatt first.</p>
				<p>It would be interesting for the moment, but like other kids, I was soon onto other ventures. Looking back, I&rsquo;m not sure I had the true appreciation of these wonders. I think back to the time when a Park Service picnic at the Grand Canyon&rsquo;s south rim was ruined <del>cut? in my mind</del> when the kids&rsquo; football game ended after the ball went over the canyon ledge, lost forever.</p>
				<p>Someday I plan on revisiting many of those parks to see all the history, natural beauty and adventure again from a new perspective &mdash; <del>this time</del> as an adult. <del>when? why haven&rsquo;t you?</del></p>
				<p>I may have not understood it at the time, but I do now &mdash; it was truly a gift to be able to experience all of it as a child. <del>but how did it change adult jim? and isn&rsquo;t that a bit forced? after you said basically it didn&rsquo;t effect your adult view of the world at all, how do you conclude that suddenly you&rsquo;ve seen the light???</del></p>
